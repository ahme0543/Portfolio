# Portfolio

My whole portfolio was used using the boostrap framework and library.the challanges that I faced while making the portfolio is figuring out where to start from and the fact that how to design your portfolio. The lesson I learned from making my portfolio is that it always has to be updated including designs and content while keeping your brand consistent too.
