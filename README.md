# Portfolio

My whole portfolio was used using the boostrap framework and library.the challanges that I faced while making the portfolio is figuring out where to start from and the fact that how to design your portfolio. The lesson I learned from making my portfolio is that it always has to be updated including designs and content while keeping your brand consistent too. another struggle that i faced was sizing the images without bootstraps and optimizing and sizing them for different breakpoints.

This is the link of the boostrap from where I used my resources and cuztomized it. 
 
I also used some aspects from W3schools and overstack along with google font.
